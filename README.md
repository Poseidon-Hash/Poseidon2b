# Poseidon2b

This repository provides research and reference code for integrating the **Poseidon2b** hash function into the [Binius](https://gitlab.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius/) framework.

The project is organized into two main components with distinct licensing origins:

1. **`binius_poseidon2b/` folder** – Based on code from the [Binius project](https://gitlab.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius/), commit [`924103fe50a9767b03c61981a5df12dafc1f44bd`](https://gitlab.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius/-/tree/924103fe50a9767b03c61981a5df12dafc1f44bd). The code has been **adapted and extended** to support the **Poseidon2b** hash function. The original Binius code is licensed under the **Apache License, Version 2.0**, see [`binius_poseidon2b/LICENSE`](binius_poseidon2b/LICENSE) for the full license text.
